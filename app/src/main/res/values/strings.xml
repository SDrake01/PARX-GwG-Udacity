    <string name="text_about_parx">PARX is a fun way to collect badges for visiting Kentucky\'s State Parks,
    and Historic Sites.\n\nAs you visit these locations, you will be making progress and earning badges
    that reflect something specific about each place you go.\n\nThere is an Appal Badge for the Appalachian Region,\n
        Daniel Boone\'s Sheltowee Badge.\nAnd others that you\'ll discover as you go.\n
        \n\nI hope you have fun exploring Kentucky!</string>
    <string name="text_how_it_works">PARX is easy!\n\n All you have to do is to open the app when
    you are at a State Park or State Historic Site, and your progress will be recorded automatically.</string>
